There is more capital than workforce.


As the welfare of a subset of the society rises more relative to ther subsets, the less people from that subset are motivated to improve their environment and the enironment of other subsets of society, since it creates a welfare bubble, a feeling of satisfaction for them. Unfortunately, when there is a high difference in welfare levels between subsets of society, conflicts arise between them.


Welfare is a utopian status where one does not need to do work, and is not responsible for the welfare of others, not even for the society and has large amount of freedom to entertain herself, himself as the responsibility of achieving welfare is already fulfilled. This is also a dystopian status, a constant existence of social and personal problems are essential: we strive in stimulus and problems, but we cease to be when there is nothing to go for.


Of course, if a nations every individual takes it as their own responsibility to keep things up, things can be kept up on the long-term. However this seems to fall off balance, if we look at the difference of the types of conflicts between and within different nation/regions/countries. At one side we have armed war, on the other we civilans living their everyday life on the wave of global economy.

Surely we generally want improvement in our lives from today to tomorrow. This means a better situation for ourselves our family, friends our nation our region and then, but only then, for everyone. However it is too our responsibility to help and make effort according to these levels.


With technological advancement, we will always make our lives better, and we will always find new problems that need to be solved. It is not possible to „reach” a utopia neither a dystopia, since one would mean the other is coming soon. We do have bad times, good times, - on personal and on societal level and in the present, it impossible to judge we are in the good times or the bad times. It is always after that we see in retrospect.


These imbalances we have in our society today create conflicts between people, nations, regions and so on, and different types of conflicts. Since we live together - generally speaking on earth - we do have to face these probelms sooner or later, and see probelms from more points of views. This is just like probelms in a relationship between a couple. You can hide from them and carry them to your next relationship, or face them and solve them early. Psychological, and societal problems alike.


An important action to take today is balance our current society more from a lot of aspects: welfare, culture, political status, education, views, religions, etc. Balancing happens with talking, writing, reading, learing about everything around us. In other words being open, stepping out of our comfort zones. Both on a personal level and on the level of society. Otherwise we might risk going into the worse type of unknown.
