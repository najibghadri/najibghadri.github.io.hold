About me
======
I studied computer science in Budapest University of Technology, and finished my Masters in 2020. I specialized in different and exciting branches of today's computer science: classical Software Development and Engineering, Blockchain and www technologies and Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Deep Learning.

My recent work has been focused on artifical intelligence in computer vision in my work of ... link

I made a startup initiative for a mobile social network, Gambjo, with the goal of helping real outdoor social interactions, with 5 other engineer friends of mine, but we had to halt the idea, as apparently it's not our time. But we still believe in it!

I envision the Next Web, the future of the WWW, where you have decentralization of central authorities (like DNS, PKI) and validity and security of information and digital identity through distributed ladder technology (maybe not blockchain though) and linked-data and interoperability of web/mobile/desktop applications. This implemented on a new platform that acts as both an operating system and a web/mobile/desktop application platform could drastically improve productivity over our legacy systems of Linux which I favor for compatibility and open-serouce cooperation and Windows which is sucessful in all sectors for business applications.

However any company could initiate this direction, even Gambjo :)..
